//! # Container Drivers
//!
//! This module provides the core functionality for building and managing
//! development containers.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The driver module handles:
//! - Processing and downloading devcontainer features from registries
//! - Building container images with Dockerfiles
//! - Starting and managing container instances
//!
//! ## Submodules
//!
//! - [`container`] - Container lifecycle management (build, start, stop)
//!
//! ## Feature Processing
//!
//! Features can be sourced from:
//! - **Registry** - Downloaded from OCI-compliant registries like ghcr.io
//! - **Local** - Loaded from the local filesystem (not yet implemented)
